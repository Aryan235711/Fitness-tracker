# Fitness Tracker

Creating a fitness application for myself.

## Project Overview

- **Language:** Python
- **Purpose:** This project is a personal fitness tracker. It is designed to help log workouts, monitor progress, and analyze fitness metrics.
- **Audience:** Personal use, but can be adapted for anyone looking to start tracking their fitness journey with Python.

## How the Project Works

- Contains Python scripts for tracking exercises, storing workout data, and generating fitness summaries.
- Data is likely saved in local files (e.g., CSV, JSON, or SQLite database) for easy access and modification.
- Scripts may include functions for adding new workouts, viewing progress, and generating reports or visualizations.

## Features

- Log workouts (e.g., exercise name, sets, reps, weight, duration)
- View and analyze workout history
- Generate progress reports or simple visualizations
- Easily customizable for new metrics or tracking needs

## How can I edit this code?

**On GitHub Codespaces:**
